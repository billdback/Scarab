    Allows events to be queued in time-based order, so they can be sent at the correct times.  Events are `put`
    into the queue and then sorted based on event times.  Then, when a `get` is called, the next, soonest event is
    returned.  Events for the same time are returned in the order they were added.

    The queue will not allow events to be entered that are before the most recently retrieved time.  For example, if
    an event is retried (`get`) that is at time 3, then an error will be added if an event is added that comes before 3.
    Also, event times much be non-negative, i.e. >= 0.
