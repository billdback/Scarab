    This class is a simplified version of the Simulation class that allows for easy testing of entities.  All functions
    in this class are synchronous to make testing easier.

    What it does:

    * Can add entities
    * Can send events (and includes specific functions for each type of valid event).
    * Can step one time unit at a time.

    What is not supported:

    * Web socket.
    * Running for multiple steps.
